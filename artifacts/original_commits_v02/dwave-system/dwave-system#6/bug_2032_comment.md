The solver object is updated with additional data which are received via client-server communication. The interpretation of the information coming from the server responsed has to be used in a different way internally. Fix: use the node attribute of the solver object, instead of encoding_qubits, to avoid duplicates. (solver class: self.nodes = self.variables = set(self._encoding_qubits))
