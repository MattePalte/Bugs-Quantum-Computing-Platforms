Reporter: "The functions strawberryfields.ops.Catstate andstrawberryfields.utils.states.cat_state do not work properly with a large Fock dimension cut-off. Inside these functions, the ket's array is initialized as type int32 due to (I think) an earlier use of np.arange with int32 argument. As a result, some of the maths that is performed further on in the function evaluates to 0 when the number is sufficiently large." Fixer: "Fix cat state function array type without doing casting"
