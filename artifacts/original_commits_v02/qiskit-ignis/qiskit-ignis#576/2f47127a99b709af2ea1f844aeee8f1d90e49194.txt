Fix tox.ini lint job's basepython (#576)

In #568 a change the lint job definition was accidently made which
changed the base python version for the job from python3 to python 3.8.
This was done for my local testing as the version of pylint we're
currently using doesn't support python 3.9 (which is my default python3
interpreter). However, this should not have been committed (especially
as part of #568 which is completely unrelated) as it's not general and
will only work if someone has a python3.8 interpreter installed. This
commit reverts that change to ensure the tox.ini is usable for anyone.
In a follow up commit we'll bump the pylint version to one that's python
3.9 compatible so local workarounds like this aren't needed anymore.
