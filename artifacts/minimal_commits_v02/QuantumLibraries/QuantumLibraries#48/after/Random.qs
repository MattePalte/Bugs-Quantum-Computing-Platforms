    // DESIGN NOTES:
    //     Q# functions *CANNOT* have side effects. Since random sampling is a side
    //     effect, this immediately implies that any random number generation is modeled
    //     as an operation. That in turn implies that random number generation calls inside
    //     another operation will break adjointability and controllability.

    /// Generates a random integer uniformly sampled from all integers that can be represented
	/// in a given number of bits.
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## maxBits
    /// The number of classical bits required to represent the largest integer
    /// that could be returned by this operation.
    ///
    /// # Output
    /// An integer $x$ uniformly at random from the given interval;
