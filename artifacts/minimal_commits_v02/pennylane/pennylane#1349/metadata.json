The Jax interface makes a copy of the current tape to take it's derivative, but the tape copy didn't copy over differentiation information.\" Fixer: \"Copying the `JacobianTape` now correctly also copies the `jacobian_options` attribute. This fixes a bug\n  allowing the JAX interface to support adjoint differentiation.\""}
