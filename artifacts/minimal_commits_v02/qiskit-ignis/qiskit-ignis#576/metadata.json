However, this should not have been committed (especially\r\nas part of #568 which is completely unrelated) as it's not general and\r\nwill only work if someone has a python3.8 interpreter installed. This\r\ncommit reverts that change to ensure the tox.ini is usable for anyone.\r\nIn a follow up commit we'll bump the pylint version to one that's python\r\n3.9 compatible so local workarounds like this aren't needed anymore.", "project_name": "qiskit-ignis", "id": "33", "human_id": "qiskit-ignis#576", "author_comment": "In a tox.ini python3.8 was too specific, working only for people who had it. Bug-fix: moved to python 3 which is general"}
