Fix sign error in EjectFullW and silent merge error in eject_z_test.py (#691)

- Slipped by because of a silent merge conflict overwriting updated methods with old ones
- The old methods were calling the new "canonicalize_up_to_measurement_phase" with the wrong number of arguments, triggering a type error, triggering a path expecting a type error for a *different reason* (i.e. non-unitary operations in the circuit)
- Removed the non-unitary fallback path and renamed the method to make it clear only measurement-implies-terminal circuits were expected
- Simplified the W-over-partial-W derivation
- Fixed false-positive assertions that were now correctly failing
- Added a test that fails for the old behavior but not for the new behavior
