This allowed a problem with the retworkx\r\nmigration to remain undetected (see #565 ).\r\n\r\n- A test has now been added (as well as refactoring to make testing easier).\r\n- A change to the weight calculation method was also made to improve accuracy.\r\n\r\nFixes #565\r\n\r\n* Update circuits.py\r\n\r\nTesting commit\r\n\r\n* Revert \"Update circuits.py\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 32e66b67d8ee3a0c5b1bd45e6b760e8c51c82570.\r\n\r\n* Update circuits.py\r\n\r\n* Update circuits.py\r\n\r\n* Update circuits.py\r\n\r\n* Removing spaces, rename +,- to X-basis\r\n\r\n* Revert \"Adding logical identity, change to +,- basis for repetition code\"\r\n\r\n* improve error calculation\r\n\r\n* change edges to correct form\r\n\r\n* add test for weights\r\n\r\n* fix some linting errors\r\n\r\n* change to update_edge\r\n\r\n* fix more linting errors\r\n\r\n* fix final linting error\r\n\r\n* preventing exceptions for rare cases\r\n\r\n* retrigger checks\r\n\r\n* Update qiskit/ignis/verification/topological_codes/fitters.py\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\r\n\r\n* Update qiskit/ignis/verification/topological_codes/fitters.py\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\r\n\r\n* Update qiskit/ignis/verification/topological_codes/fitters.py\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\r\n\r\n* Update qiskit/ignis/verification/topological_codes/fitters.py\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\r\n\r\n* Update qiskit/ignis/verification/topological_codes/fitters.py\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\r\n\r\n* delete blank line\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: jagunther <58778456+jagunther@users.noreply.github.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Christopher J.
