Fix weight calculation (#567)

The weight_syndrome_graph method of Decoder objects previously
did not have an explicit test. This allowed a problem with the retworkx
migration to remain undetected (see #565 ).

- A test has now been added (as well as refactoring to make testing easier).
- A change to the weight calculation method was also made to improve accuracy.
