Fix condtional instructions using `c_if` not working for reg of size>=64 on BasicAer backend (#1089)

When executing on the `BasicAer` backend `c_if` either result in a
crash for if the conditional register was 64-bits wide, or just not
work for registers > 64-bits.

The `hex2bin` routine in `util.hpp` used 8 hex-character instead
for 16 for the block size to process in 64-bit chunks.
Also added check to avoid invoking `std::stoull` with empty string,
which was causing the crashes.

In the implementation of `ClassicalRegister::apply_bfunc,` truncated
the leading zeros before comparing the masked register value with the
target value for the condtional.
