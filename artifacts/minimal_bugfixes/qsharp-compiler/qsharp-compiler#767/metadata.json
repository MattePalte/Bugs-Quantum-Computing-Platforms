It adds handling for ExpressionKind.NOT so that those conditions get properly restructured and processed for lifting (fixes #763)\r\n2. If a conditional statement has an empty scope, it gets replaced with a call to `NoOp` instead of being lifted into an empty callable.\r\n\r\n* Refactor use of QsNullable in ProcessNOT\r\n\r\n* Remove attempted fix for IsValidScope propagation\r\n\r\n* Adding test cases for NOT", "project_name": "qsharp-compiler", "id": "1216", "human_id": "qsharp-compiler#767", "annotator_comment": "Fixer: \"This change includes 3 fixes/updates to the ClassicallyControlled rewrite step\". Reporter: \"For example, the if-condition if (M(q) != One) will correctly be handled (since it is ExpressionKind.NEQ), but the condition if (not (M(q) == One)) will not be transformed and then will fail target translation at execution time.\""}
