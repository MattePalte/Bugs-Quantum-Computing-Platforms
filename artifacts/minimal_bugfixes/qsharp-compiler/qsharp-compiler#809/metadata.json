However, this means that if a given callable has a specialization that is unused, any callables only referred to in that specialization will have no edges and will not be included in the concrete graph, even though the specialization itself is not pruned. The end result is that the specialization will use types corresponding to callabes that are not generated, resulting in a compilation failure.\""}
