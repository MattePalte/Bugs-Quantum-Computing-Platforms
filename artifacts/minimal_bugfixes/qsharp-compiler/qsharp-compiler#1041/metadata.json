We confirmed locally that returning this to explicitly check for the bson fixes the incremental build and meets the needs of the scenarios we cover. I'm hopeful that this will also address QSC reruns in pipeline even when it shouldn't #932 but it's possible the pipeline issue is actually unrelated.", "project_name": "qsharp-compiler", "id": "1234", "human_id": "qsharp-compiler#1041", "annotator_comment": "During the incremental build there is a xml like file which determines and output file with a wildecard extension (.*) and that ruined the entire build process."}
