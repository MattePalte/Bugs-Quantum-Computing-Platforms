Fix #885 (#886)

* [WIP] Started updating VS LSP client.
* A few more nullability fixes.
* Use explicit 0:0 range instead of relying on constructor.
* Propagate nullability metadata to F# callers.
* Avoid calling unsafe constructors.
* Avoid deprecated Assert.Equals.
* Set DocumentRangeFormattingProvider to false.
* Fix to AssertCapability.
* Assertions should work more reliabily when capabilities are null.
* Disable nullable reference checking when copying unsound types.
* Check if Range is null, since nullability metadata can be violated.
