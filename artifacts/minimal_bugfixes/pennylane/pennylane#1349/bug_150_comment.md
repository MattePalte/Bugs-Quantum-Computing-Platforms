Reporter: "Currently, the jax interface fails to return correct results with the adjoint differentiation method. The Jax interface makes a copy of the current tape to take it's derivative, but the tape copy didn't copy over differentiation information." Fixer: "Copying the `JacobianTape` now correctly also copies the `jacobian_options` attribute. This fixes a bug
  allowing the JAX interface to support adjoint differentiation."
