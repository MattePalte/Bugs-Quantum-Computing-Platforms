The reason it didn't come up earlier, as I haven't tested on g3 since my change in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3917#discussion_r597349479 - I think that more principled rewiring surfaced this bug :)", "project_name": "Cirq", "id": "1571", "human_id": "Cirq#3948", "author_comment": "This bug happens in a python file which import libraries in a diret way with importlib, because of compatibility issues."}
