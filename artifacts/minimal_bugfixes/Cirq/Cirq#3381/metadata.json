It also adds the ability to deprecate classes properly via `@deprecate_class`.\r\n\r\nFixes #3380.", "project_name": "Cirq", "id": "1518", "human_id": "Cirq#3381", "annotator_comment": "Reporter: \"cirq.TrialResult was deprecated for cirq.Result, however the json parsing did not follow correctly the deprecation, the new code breaks on the old json format.\" \"The @deprecated decorator was used incorrectly on a class which made cirq.TrialResult into an object of type function\". This code is used while reading the json format and mapping it to the correpsonding cirq function."}
