Reporter: "cirq.TrialResult was deprecated for cirq.Result, however the json parsing did not follow correctly the deprecation, the new code breaks on the old json format." "The @deprecated decorator was used incorrectly on a class which made cirq.TrialResult into an object of type function". This code is used while reading the json format and mapping it to the correpsonding cirq function.
