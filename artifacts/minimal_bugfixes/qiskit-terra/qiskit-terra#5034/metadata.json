It does this by changing\nthe internal _Subscriber class to determine equality based on the callback\nfunction object id, instead of just by name.\n\nTo prevent errors described in #5012, it avoids running the progress bar update if it\nhas not been initialized yet (i.e. start() has not run yet). It also\nskips update when it doesn't make sense (e.g. step iteration is greater than\nthe set total number of iterations on start).\n\nThis is sensitive to object ids in order to work, so as long as the callbacks\nare dynamically defined functions, this will work.\n\nCo-authored-by: Luciano Bello <luciano.bello@ibm.com>", "project_name": "qiskit-terra", "id": "679", "human_id": "qiskit-terra#5034", "annotator_comment": "Reporter: \"The problem is that the event infrastructure in Terra is global and sometimes we get crashes on the instance variable the TextBarProgress keeps (self.iter) since a single TextProgressBar receives all those events from parallel_map in mixed orders when actually they should apply to separate progress bars.\""}
