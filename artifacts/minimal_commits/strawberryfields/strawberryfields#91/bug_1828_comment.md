Fixer: "Previously, since there was just a single object, the New_modes.n instance variable would be overwritten each time New.__call__ was called. New_modes.n is currently only used by New_modes.__str__, which is why this bug escaped notice. This should be a drop-in replacement." Fix: "Replaces the ops.New singleton object with a similarly named function that creates a New_modes instance and appends it to the Program." The concept swaping here is between New and New_modes function call.
