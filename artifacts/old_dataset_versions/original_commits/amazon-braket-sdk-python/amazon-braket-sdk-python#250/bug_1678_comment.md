Fixer: "Introduces `fixed_qubit_count` so customers don't need to instantiate a gate or noise operation to see its qubit count. Also fixes a bug (REAL BUG HERE) that occurs when checking compatibility of gate and noise qubit counts, where the gate is always instantiated with no arguments, which obviously fails for parametrized gates.". We count all the modification for this beacuse the fix qubit api ws required to fix also the gate and noise compatibility.
