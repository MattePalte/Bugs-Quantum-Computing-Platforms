Fix random crashes on TextProgressBar (#5034)

This is a proposed fix for #5012.

It allows more than one subscriber per event, so that bad subscribers
don't block good subscribers from getting events. It does this by changing
the internal _Subscriber class to determine equality based on the callback
function object id, instead of just by name.

To prevent errors described in #5012, it avoids running the progress bar update if it
has not been initialized yet (i.e. start() has not run yet). It also
skips update when it doesn't make sense (e.g. step iteration is greater than
the set total number of iterations on start).

This is sensitive to object ids in order to work, so as long as the callbacks
are dynamically defined functions, this will work.
