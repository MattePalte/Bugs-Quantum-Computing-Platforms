Moment in a circuit refers to discrete time intervals in which we can schedule our operations. When we create a circuit we might have gates which act on different qubits. If that is the case we should allow two gate scheduled on different qubits to belong to the same moment. In the internal representation this is already the case, but when the plotting function which represent the circuit is called, then two overlapping CNOT gates (which require 2 qubit each) will be scheduled in two separate moments according to the ASCII output. Which makes a bug.
