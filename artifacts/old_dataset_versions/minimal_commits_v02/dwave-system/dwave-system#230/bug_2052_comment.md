Fixer: "Bug root cause: the test that was failing, embedding composite with initial_state and annealing_schedule, was not properly fetching/using a solver that supports those features. The reason why this test was passing before is pure luck. It was using the cloud-client v0.5.0 which was returning solvers in different order, so by chance a QPU solver was the default. In v0.5.1 the order changed, and required solver features had to be explicitly listed."
