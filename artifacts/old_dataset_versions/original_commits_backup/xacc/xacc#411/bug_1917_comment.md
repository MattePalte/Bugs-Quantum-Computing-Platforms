In the binding between C++ code and Python (with pybind11), sometimes the C++ code has overloading of methods. To do that we need a special procedure for the binding ( https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/classes.html#overloaded-methods ). The bug is present because sometimes we handle the case in which the list (passed as parameter) is a list of Qasm or Quil object, but we did not address the case where it is neither of them two. The bug fix addresses it providing a casting.
