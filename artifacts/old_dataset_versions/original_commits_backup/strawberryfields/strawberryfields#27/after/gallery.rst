Applications and plugins
------------------------

The following list of applications and plugins build on the Strawberry Fields framework; extending Strawberry Fields to allow it to tackle and solve new problems, or by providing an interface between other software frameworks.

* `Quantum Machine Learning Toolbox <https://github.com/XanaduAI/QMLT>`_

  The Quantum Machine Learning Toolbox (QMLT) is a Strawberry Fields application that simplifies the optimization of variational quantum circuits. It provides helper functions commonly used in machine learning and optimization (such as for regularization), and includes a numerical learner, that can be used to optimize with the Gaussian and Fock backends.

* `SFOpenBoson <https://github.com/XanaduAI/SFOpenBoson>`_

  A plugin for Strawberry Fields and OpenFermion, SFOpenBoson integrates the photonic quantum circuit simulation capability of Strawberry Fields with the OpenFermion quantum chemistry package. This allows bosonic Hamiltonians defined in OpenFermion to be decomposed and simulated directly in Strawberry Fields.
