Fix ClassicallyControlled Rewrite bugs (#767)

* Fix ClassicallyControlled Rewrite bugs

This change includes 3 fixes/updates to the ClassicallyControlled rewrite step:
1. It adds handling for ExpressionKind.NOT so that those conditions get properly restructured and processed for lifting (fixes #763)
2. If a conditional statement has an empty scope, it gets replaced with a call to `NoOp` instead of being lifted into an empty callable.

* Refactor use of QsNullable in ProcessNOT

* Remove attempted fix for IsValidScope propagation

* Adding test cases for NOT
